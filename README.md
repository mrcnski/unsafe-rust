# [Presentation] Memory Management in Unsafe Rust

**Note:** this repo was restored with the help of [SoftwareHeritage](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/directory/?origin_url=https://github.com/m-cat/unsafe-rust). git history remains lost.

These are the slides to a talk I gave to my coworkers at [MaidSafe](maidsafe.net). It was meant to be a broad overview of Rust unsafe code and FFI design, and includes the motivations as well as the background concepts necessary to understand the design of the FFI API I implemented for [parsec](https://github.com/maidsafe/parsec). I wanted it to be grokkable to beginners but still useful to experts -- I hope I succeeded in that rather lofty goal :)

The presentation file is `unsafe-rust.html`. It was generated from the source file `unsafe-rust.org` using Emacs and [`org-reveal`](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal).
